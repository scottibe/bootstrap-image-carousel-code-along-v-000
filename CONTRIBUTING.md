Your favorite fitness tracker may not be totally accurate, according to a study used in an amended complaint filed Thursday against Fitbit.

The class-action lawsuit, filed earlier this year, argues that the PurePulse technology used in the Fitbit trackers that measure your heart rate doesn't do it as well as the company's marketing material promises, a claim Fitbit denies. The technology is used in the more expensive models of the device, the Surge, Blaze and Charge HR.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of people who bought these Fitbits specially to help them track their heart rate, whether for health reasons or to make sure they are getting the most out of their workouts.
"We are not arguing that it is a medical device. I think that is irrelevant," said Jonathan Selbin, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit. "This is about the way they market it and that they charge a premium for the heart rate monitor, but it's not giving a meaningful measurement."

The suit alleges that a defect in the trackers is a safety hazard because people who rely on inaccurate heart rate readings for medical purposes could be at risk. The class-action members say there is no reasonable way for them to know that the devices can be inaccurate and that they might not have even bought them if they knew.
The amended complaint, filed Thursday, added a new study that looked at how the trackers worked for 43 healthy adults, compared with an ECG and against each other. The participants wore two Fitbits during the test.
The study -- which was funded by the legal team that brought the lawsuit -- found that the devices were off by, on average, 20 beats per minute during moderate- to high-intensity exercise. The lawsuit concludes that the "devices could not provide meaningful heart rate data" when someone is exercising.

"It works pretty well when you are resting," study co-author Edward Jo said. But Fitbit is "advertised to people who exercise," and ads suggest that the trackers are "counting every beat."
Researchers tested the device on 22 men and 21 women, who were observed in a single visit. They wore the devices, a Zephyr Technology BioHarness and a single-channel ECG sensor. Monitored for 65 minutes, the subjects were asked to perform physical activities that were similar to ones represented in the Fitbit ads, including a standing rest, a self-paced jog, jumping rope, climbing stairs, fast movement exercise, treadmill running and a seated rest.
